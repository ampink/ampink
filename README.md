- 👋 Hi, I’m @ampink MSc, CSEP-CEP, CSEP-HPS, PhD student
- 👀 I’m interested in any data related to sport and health, and the subsequent interpretation and use of said data. Current projects involve: 
    - Longitudinal analysis of varsity athletes,
    - Injury tracking in the NFL and NHL.
- 🌱 I’m currently completing my PhD in Epidemiology looking at how injury development in NHL players relates to training load and playing volume.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with sports science.
